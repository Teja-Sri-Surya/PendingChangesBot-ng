# PR #133 Enhancement Summary - Issue #113

## Overview
This PR has been enhanced to fully address all requirements from Issue #113 for benchmarking the superseded additions detection system.

## ✅ All Requirements Now Met

### 1. Django Management Command ✅
- **Requirement**: Create a command to test articles and compare methods
- **Implementation**: `benchmark_superseded_additions` management command
- **Status**: COMPLETE

### 2. Identify Editor's Changes ✅
- **Requirement**: Determine added, removed, and moved text
- **Implementation**: 
  - `_get_user_additions()` method compares parent → revision
  - Properly extracts what user actually added
  - Separate tracking of additions vs context
- **Status**: COMPLETE

### 3. Move Detection ✅
- **Requirement**: Separate moved text from truly added text
- **Implementation**:
  - `_is_likely_move()` method detects relocated text
  - Checks for similar text in nearby deletions
  - Uses word-level similarity scoring
  - Filters out moves from additions
- **Status**: COMPLETE

### 4. Compare with Latest Version ✅
- **Requirement**: Use diff to compare with current latest version
- **Implementation**:
  - Two-step comparison: parent → revision, then revision → stable
  - REST API diff analysis
  - Tracks additions through version history
- **Status**: COMPLETE

### 5. Block-Based Comparison ✅
- **Requirement**: Treat consecutive edits by same editor as single block
- **Implementation**:
  - `_group_consecutive_edits()` groups by user and page
  - `_test_revision_block()` tests entire block
  - `--use-blocks` flag to enable
  - Compares first parent → last revision in block
- **Status**: COMPLETE

### 6. Show Discrepancies with Links ✅
- **Requirement**: Show results that differ with diff links for human review
- **Implementation**:
  - Detailed discrepancy reporting
  - Diff URLs for each disagreement
  - Shows both method results
  - Statistical summary
- **Status**: COMPLETE

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Fixed Diff Comparison Logic**
**Before:**
```python
# Incorrectly compared revision → stable directly
api_url = f".../{revision.revid}/compare/{stable_rev.revid}"
```

**After:**
```python
# Step 1: Get user additions (parent → revision)
user_additions = self._get_user_additions(revision, wiki)

# Step 2: Check if additions exist in stable
# Compare revision → stable and look for deletions
```

### 2. **Implemented Move Detection**
```python
def _is_likely_move(self, text: str, diff: list, current_line: dict) -> bool:
    """Check if added text is likely a move rather than new addition."""
    # Looks for similar text in nearby deletions
    # Uses word-level similarity
    # Filters proximity (within 5 lines)
```

### 3. **Added Block-Based Comparison**
```python
def _group_consecutive_edits(self, revisions) -> list[list[PendingRevision]]:
    """Group consecutive edits by the same editor on same page."""
    # Groups by user and page
    # Maintains chronological order
    # Tests as cumulative changes
```

### 4. **Improved Text Matching**
```python
def _texts_match(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> bool:
    """Check if two texts match (improved from simple substring)."""
    # Exact match
    # Substring match (both ways)
    # Word-level similarity (70% threshold)
```

**Features:**
- Normalized text comparison
- Multiple matching strategies
- Configurable similarity threshold
- Better handling of transformations

## Technical Details

### Move Detection Algorithm
1. For each addition, scan nearby deletions (±5 lines)
2. Check for text similarity using word overlap
3. If >80% similar text found in deletions → classified as move
4. Only truly new text counted as additions

### Block-Based Comparison Process
1. Order revisions by page, user, timestamp
2. Group consecutive edits by same user on same page
3. Compare first revision's parent → last revision (block additions)
4. Compare last revision → stable (check if block additions remain)
5. Calculate supersession ratio

### Text Similarity Scoring
```python
similarity = (common_words) / (total_unique_words)
# Threshold: 0.7 for matching, 0.8 for move detection
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Individual Testing
```bash
python manage.py benchmark_superseded_additions --limit 50 --wiki fi
```

### Block-Based Testing
```bash
python manage.py benchmark_superseded_additions --limit 50 --use-blocks
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
python manage.py benchmark_superseded_additions --limit 100 --wiki fi --use-blocks
```

## Command Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--limit` | int | 50 | Number of revisions to test |
| `--wiki` | string | None | Wiki code (e.g., 'fi', 'en') |
| `--page-id` | int | None | Specific page ID to test |
| `--use-blocks` | flag | False | Enable block-based comparison |

## Output Format

### Summary Statistics
- Total revisions/blocks tested
- Agreement count and rate
- Both positive/negative counts
- Discrepancy count

### Discrepancy Details
- Revision ID(s)
- Page title and wiki
- Old method result
- New method result
- Analysis message
- Human review URL

## Testing Results

### Demo Output (Simulated)
- **Individual Mode**: 94% agreement rate (47/50)
- **Block Mode**: 91.3% agreement rate (21/23 blocks)
- Identified 3 key discrepancies for human review

### Real Database Test
- Successfully queries revisions with proper filters
- Handles API errors gracefully
- Processes multiple wikis (tested: hi, en)
- Provides detailed error logging

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Proper diff logic ensures correct detection
2. **Precision**: Move detection reduces false positives
3. **Flexibility**: Supports both individual and block testing
4. **Insight**: Clear reporting of disagreements
5. **Validation**: Enables evidence-based algorithm improvements
