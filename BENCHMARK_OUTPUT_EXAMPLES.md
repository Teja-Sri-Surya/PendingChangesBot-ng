---

### Scenario D: Block-Based Comparison
```bash
python manage.py benchmark_superseded_additions --use-blocks --limit 30
```

```
=== Superseded Additions Benchmark ===

Grouping revisions into edit blocks...

Testing 12 edit blocks...

=== Results Summary ===

Total revisions tested: 12
Both methods agree: 10
  - Both say superseded: 4
  - Both say NOT superseded: 6
Discrepancies found: 2

=== Discrepancies (Need Human Review) ===

Revision: Block: 1234567, 1234568, 1234569 on Helsinki (fi)
  Old method: NOT SUPERSEDED
  New method: SUPERSEDED
  Message: Block of 3 edits
  Diff URL: https://fi.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helsinki&diff=1234569&oldid=1234566

Revision: Block: 9876543, 9876544 on Turku (fi)
  Old method: SUPERSEDED
  New method: NOT SUPERSEDED
  Message: Block of 2 edits
  Diff URL: https://fi.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turku&diff=9876544&oldid=9876542

Agreement rate: 83.3%
```

**Key Differences:**
- 🔄 Groups consecutive edits by same editor
- 📦 Tests blocks instead of individual revisions
- 🎯 More realistic assessment of cumulative changes

---

### Scenario E: No Revisions Found
```bash
python manage.py benchmark_superseded_additions --wiki xyz --limit 50
```

```
=== Superseded Additions Benchmark ===

No revisions found to test.
```

**When This Happens:**
- Database doesn't have revisions for specified criteria
- Wiki code doesn't exist
- All revisions filtered out (no parent, no wikitext, etc.)

## 📈 Agreement Rate Interpretation

| Rate | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| **90-100%** | Excellent alignment | New method validates old one |
| **70-89%** | Good agreement | Some edge cases differ |
| **50-69%** | Moderate disagreement | Review discrepancies |
| **Below 50%** | High divergence | Investigate thoroughly |

## 💡 How to Use Results

### 1. Review Discrepancies
Click the Diff URLs to see actual changes on Wikipedia

### 2. Determine Accuracy
For each discrepancy, decide which method is correct:
- Is the text actually still present? (Old method correct)
- Was the text removed/replaced? (New method correct)
- Was the text moved? (New method should detect this)

### 3. Track Patterns
Look for patterns in false positives/negatives:
- Specific types of edits
- Particular wikis or languages
- Certain page categories

### 4. Improve Algorithms
Use findings to:
- Adjust similarity thresholds
- Improve move detection
- Refine text matching
- Update documentation

### 5. Make Decisions
Use statistics to:
- Set auto-approval thresholds
- Determine confidence levels
- Validate algorithm changes
- Justify methodology choices
