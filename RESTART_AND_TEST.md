# ✅ ALL BUGS FIXED - Ready to Test!

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### Bug #1: JSON Parsing Error ✅
**Error:** `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON`  
**Cause:** Missing URL routes in `urls.py`  
**Fix:** Added proper routes for `/validate_article/`, `/fetch_revisions/`, `/fetch_predictions/`

### Bug #2: Article Not Found Error ✅
**Error:** `Article "Earth" not found on en.wikipedia.org`  
**Cause:** Function was looking for Wiki objects in empty database  
**Fix:** Changed to construct API endpoints directly from wiki codes
