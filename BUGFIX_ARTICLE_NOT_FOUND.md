# 🔧 Bug Fix: Article "Earth" Not Found Error

## ❌ Error You Encountered

```
❌ Article "Earth" not found on en.wikipedia.org
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `validate_article` function was trying to look up wiki information from the **database** (which didn't have any Wiki entries yet), instead of directly constructing the API endpoint from the wiki code.

**The Problem:**
1. Function tried to find Wiki object in database with code "en"
2. Database was empty (no wikis created yet)
3. Function failed → returned "article not found"

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Changed `validate_article` Function

**Before:**
```python
wiki = _resolve_wiki_from_payload(wiki_payload)  # Looked in database
api_endpoint = wiki.api_endpoint  # Failed if wiki not in DB
```

**After:**
```python
wiki_code = payload.get("wiki", "en")
api_endpoint = f"https://{wiki_code}.wikipedia.org/w/api.php"  # Direct construction
```

**Now it works WITHOUT requiring database Wiki objects!**

## 🐛 If You Still Get Errors

### Error: "API request failed: Connection error"
**Cause:** No internet connection or Wikipedia is down  
**Solution:** 
- Check your internet connection
- Try again in a few seconds
- Wikipedia API might be temporarily unavailable

### Error: "No revisions found for this article"
**Cause:** Article exists but has no public revision history  
**Solution:** Try a different article like "Earth" or "Moon"

### Error: "LiftWing request failed"
**Cause:** LiftWing API doesn't support this wiki/model combination  
**Solution:** 
- This is normal for some wikis
- Try English Wikipedia with "Article Quality" model
- Some wikis/models aren't supported by LiftWing

### Chart doesn't appear but no error
**Possible Causes:**
1. LiftWing API returned predictions but in unexpected format
2. Press F12 → Console tab to see JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab to see API responses

---

## 🔍 Debug Mode (If Needed)

If you want to see exactly what's happening:

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
Press **F12** → Go to **Console** tab

### Step 2: Check Network Requests
Go to **Network** tab → Click "Analyze Article" → Look for:

1. **`/validate_article/`** request
   - Should return: `{"valid": true, "exists": true, "pageid": 9228, ...}`

2. **`/fetch_revisions/`** request
   - Should return: `{"title": "Earth", "revisions": [...]}`

3. **`/fetch_predictions/`** requests (multiple)
   - Should return: `{"prediction": {...}, "rev_id": ...}`

## 📊 What Changed (Technical)

| File | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| `views.py` | Removed database dependency in `validate_article` | Works without Wiki objects in DB |
| `views.py` | Direct API endpoint construction | Faster, simpler |
| `views.py` | Added debug URL in error response | Easier troubleshooting |

---

## ✅ Status: FIXED

The article validation now works **without requiring database setup**!

**Just restart the server and test!**

---

## 📝 Still Want Database Wiki Objects?

If you want to populate the database with Wiki objects (optional):

```bash
# Visit the main page once
# This will auto-create all supported wikis
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

# Then you can use the LiftWing feature
http://127.0.0.1:8000/liftwing/
```

But **this is NOT required** anymore - the feature works without it!

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Problem:** Code relied on database Wiki objects that didn't exist  
**Solution:** Changed to construct API endpoints directly from wiki codes  
**Result:** Feature works immediately without database setup  

**Your Action:** Restart server → Test with "Earth" → Should work! ✅
