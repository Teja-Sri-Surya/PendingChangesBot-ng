# Clean PR Instructions for @zache-fi

## Problem:
The current PR #93 shows unnecessary `myproject` directory files in the diff, which is confusing and not related to the LiftWing feature.

## Solution:
I've created a clean branch `liftwing-clean` that contains only the essential LiftWing files without any unnecessary directories.

## What @zache-fi should do:

1. **Close the current PR #93** (it has unnecessary files in the diff)

2. **Create a new PR** from the `liftwing-clean` branch:
   - Source: `Teja-Sri-Surya:liftwing-clean`
   - Target: `Wikimedia-Suomi:main`
   - Title: "Implement LiftWing model visualization feature (#70)"

3. **The clean PR will show only:**
   - ✅ LiftWing model files
   - ✅ LiftWing views and URLs
   - ✅ LiftWing templates
   - ✅ Admin interface updates
   - ✅ No unnecessary files

## Benefits of the clean approach:
- **Clean diff** - Only relevant changes visible
- **No confusion** - No unnecessary files
- **Easy review** - Focus on LiftWing feature only
- **Professional** - Clean, focused implementation

## All functionality preserved:
- ✅ Complete LiftWing integration
- ✅ Parallel request optimization
- ✅ Interactive visualization
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ All commands working

The `liftwing-clean` branch is ready for a new PR!
